# top-js-jquery-sketch-pad
Project: Javascript/jQuery from The Odin Project
http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery

"In this project, you'll get a chance to actually build a pretty nifty tool to flex your Javascript and jQuery muscles. Up until now, you've had your hand held quite a bit by Codecademy. Now it's time to do it on your own. You're going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch."
